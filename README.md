Currently in preview and available for free for a limited time for Python projects, leveraging your own LLM API key from your favorite LLM provider. It's a practical way to improve code quality and reliability. For more details, reach out to the [Qodo team](https://www.qodo.ai/book-a-demo).

### 2024-11-05:
New mode - scan an entire repo, auto identify the test files, auto collect context for each test file, and extend the test suite with new tests.
See more details [here](docs/repo_coverage.md).


# Qodo-Cover
Welcome to Qodo-Cover. This focused project utilizes Generative AI to automate and enhance the generation of tests (currently mostly unit tests), aiming to streamline development workflows. Qodo-Cover can run via a terminal, and is planned to be integrated into popular CI platforms.
[![Test generation xxx](https://www.codium.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CodiumAI-CoverAgent-v240519-small-loop.gif)](https://youtu.be/fIYkSEJ4eqE?feature=shared)

We invite the community to collaborate and help extend the capabilities of Qodo Cover, continuing its development as a cutting-edge solution in the automated unit test generation domain. We also wish to inspire researchers to leverage this open-source tool to explore new test-generation techniques.


## Overview
This tool is part of a broader suite of utilities designed to automate the creation of unit tests for software projects. Utilizing advanced Generative AI models, it aims to simplify and expedite the testing process, ensuring high-quality software development. The system comprises several components:
1. **Test Runner:** Executes the command or scripts to run the test suite and generate code coverage reports.
2. **Coverage Parser:** Validates that code coverage increases as tests are added, ensuring that new tests contribute to the overall test effectiveness.
3. **Prompt Builder:** Gathers necessary data from the codebase and constructs the prompt to be passed to the Large Language Model (LLM).
4. **AI Caller:** Interacts with the LLM to generate tests based on the prompt provided.

## Installation and Usage
### Requirements
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your environment variables, which is required for calling the OpenAI API.
- Code Coverage tool: A Cobertura XML code coverage report is required for the tool to function correctly.
  - For example, in Python one could use `pytest-cov`. Add the `--cov-report=xml` option when running Pytest.
  - Note: We are actively working on adding more coverage types but please feel free to open a PR and contribute to `cover_agent/CoverageProcessor.py`

If running directly from the repository you will also need:
- Python installed on your system.
- Poetry installed for managing Python package dependencies. Installation instructions for Poetry can be found at [https://python-poetry.org/docs/](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

### Standalone Runtime
Qodo Cover can be installed as a Python Pip package or run as a standalone executable.

#### Python Pip
To install the Python Pip package directly via GitHub run the following command:
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/qodo-ai/qodo-cover.git
```

#### Binary
The binary can be run without any Python environment installed on your system (e.g. within a Docker container that does not contain Python). You can download the release for your system by navigating to the project's [release page](https://github.com/qodo-ai/qodo-cover/releases).

### Repository Setup
Run the following command to install all the dependencies and run the project from source:
```shell
poetry install
```

### Running the Code
After downloading the executable or installing the Pip package you can run the Cover Agent to generate and validate unit tests. Execute it from the command line by using the following command:
```shell
cover-agent \
  --source-file-path "<path_to_source_file>" \
  --test-file-path "<path_to_test_file>" \
  --project-root "<path_to_project_root>" \
  --code-coverage-report-path "<path_to_coverage_report>" \
  --test-command "<test_command_to_run>" \
  --test-command-dir "<directory_to_run_test_command>" \
  --coverage-type "<type_of_coverage_report>" \
  --desired-coverage <desired_coverage_between_0_and_100> \
  --max-iterations <max_number_of_llm_iterations> \
  --included-files "<optional_list_of_files_to_include>"
```

You can use the example code below to try out the Cover Agent.
(Note that the [usage_examples](docs/usage_examples.md) file provides more elaborate examples of how to use the Cover Agent)

#### Python

Follow the steps in the README.md file located in the `templated_tests/python_fastapi/` directory to setup an environment, then return to the root of the repository, and run the following command to add tests to the **python fastapi** example:
```shell
cover-agent \
  --source-file-path "templated_tests/python_fastapi/app.py" \
  --test-file-path "templated_tests/python_fastapi/test_app.py" \
  --project-root "templated_tests/python_fastapi" \
  --code-coverage-report-path "templated_tests/python_fastapi/coverage.xml" \
  --test-command "pytest --cov=. --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term" \
  --test-command-dir "templated_tests/python_fastapi" \
  --coverage-type "cobertura" \
  --desired-coverage 70 \
  --max-iterations 10
```

#### Go

For an example using **go** `cd` into `templated_tests/go_webservice`, set up the project following the `README.md`.
To work with coverage reporting, you need to install `gocov` and `gocov-xml`. Run the following commands to install these tools:
```shell
go install github.com/axw/gocov/gocov@v1.1.0
go install github.com/AlekSi/gocov-xml@v1.1.0
```
and then run the following command:
```shell
cover-agent \
  --source-file-path "app.go" \
  --test-file-path "app_test.go" \
  --code-coverage-report-path "coverage.xml" \
  --test-command "go test -coverprofile=coverage.out && gocov convert coverage.out | gocov-xml > coverage.xml" \
  --test-command-dir $(pwd) \
  --coverage-type "cobertura" \
  --desired-coverage 70 \
  --max-iterations 1
```

#### Java
For an example using **java** `cd` into `templated_tests/java_gradle`, set up the project following the [README.md](templated_tests/java_gradle/README.md).
To work with jacoco coverage reporting, follow the [README.md](templated_tests/java_gradle/README.md) Requirements section:
and then run the following command:
```shell
cover-agent \
  --source-file-path="src/main/java/com/davidparry/cover/SimpleMathOperations.java" \
  --test-file-path="src/test/groovy/com/davidparry/cover/SimpleMathOperationsSpec.groovy" \
  --code-coverage-report-path="build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.csv" \
  --test-command="./gradlew clean test jacocoTestReport" \
  --test-command-dir=$(pwd) \
  --coverage-type="jacoco" \
  --desired-coverage=70 \
  --max-iterations=1
```

### Outputs
A few debug files will be outputted locally within the repository (that are part of the `.gitignore`)
* `run.log`: A copy of the logger that gets dumped to your `stdout`
* `test_results.html`: A results table that contains the following for each generated test:
  * Test status
  * Failure reason (if applicable)
  * Exit code, 
  * `stderr`
  * `stdout`
  * Generated test

### Additional logging
If you set an environment variable `WANDB_API_KEY`, the prompts, responses, and additional information will be logged to [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/).

### Using other LLMs
This project uses LiteLLM to communicate with OpenAI and other hosted LLMs (supporting 100+ LLMs to date). To use a different model other than the OpenAI default you'll need to:
1. Export any environment variables needed by the supported LLM [following the LiteLLM instructions](https://litellm.vercel.app/docs/proxy/quick_start#supported-llms).
2. Call the name of the model using the `--model` option when calling Cover Agent.

For example (as found in the [LiteLLM Quick Start guide](https://litellm.vercel.app/docs/proxy/quick_start#supported-llms)):
```shell
export VERTEX_PROJECT="hardy-project"
export VERTEX_LOCATION="us-west"

cover-agent \
  ...
  --model "vertex_ai/gemini-pro"
```

#### OpenAI Compatible Endpoint
```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your api key>" # If <your-api-base> requires an API KEY, set this value.

cover-agent \
  ...
  --model "openai/<your model name>" \
  --api-base "<your-api-base>"
```

#### Azure OpenAI Compatible Endpoint
```shell
export AZURE_API_BASE="<your api base>" # azure api base
export AZURE_API_VERSION="<your api version>" # azure api version (optional)
export AZURE_API_KEY="<your api key>" # azure api key

cover-agent \
  ...
  --model "azure/<your deployment name>"
```
