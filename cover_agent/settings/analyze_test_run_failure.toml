## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts both the stdout and stderr from a test run, specifically for unit test regression testing. 
Your goal is to analyze the output, and summarize the failure for further analysis. 

Please provide a one-sentence summary of the error, including the following details:
- The offending line of code (if available).
- The line number where the error occurred.
- Any other relevant details or information gleaned from the stdout and stderr.

Here is the stdout and stderr from the test run:
========= 
stdout: 
{{ stdout|trim }}
=========

stderr:
========= 
{{ stderr|trim }}
=========

Now, you need to analyze the output and provide a YAML object equivalent to type $TestFailureAnalysis, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class TestFailureAnalysis(BaseModel):
    error_summary: str = Field(description="A one-sentence summary of the failure, including the offending line of code, line number, and other relevant information from the stdout/stderr.")
=====

Example output:
```yaml
error_summary: |
   ...
```

The Response should be only a valid YAML object, without any introduction text or follow-up text.

Answer:
```yaml
