    representation. So a string of the form `a𐐀b` the character offset of the
    character `a` is 0, the character offset of `𐐀` is 1 and the character
    offset of b is 3 since `𐐀` is represented using two code units in UTF-16.
    Since 3.17 clients and servers can agree on a different string encoding
    representation (e.g. UTF-8). The client announces it's supported encoding
    via the client capability [`general.positionEncodings`](#clientCapabilities).
    The value is an array of position encodings the client supports, with
    decreasing preference (e.g. the encoding at index `0` is the most preferred
    one). To stay backwards compatible the only mandatory encoding is UTF-16
    represented via the string `utf-16`. The server can pick one of the
    encodings offered by the client and signals that encoding back to the
    client via the initialize result's property
    [`capabilities.positionEncoding`](#serverCapabilities). If the string value
    `utf-16` is missing from the client's capability `general.positionEncodings`
    servers can safely assume that the client supports UTF-16. If the server
    omits the position encoding in its initialize result the encoding defaults
    to the string value `utf-16`. Implementation considerations: since the
    conversion from one encoding into another requires the content of the
    file / line the conversion is best done where the file is read which is
    usually on the server side.

    Positions are line end character agnostic. So you can not specify a position
    that denotes `\r|\n` or `\n|` where `|` represents the character offset.
