            llm_model (str): The language model to be used for test generation.
            api_base (str, optional): The base API url to use in case model is set to Ollama or Hugging Face. Defaults to an empty string.
            test_command_dir (str, optional): The directory where the test command should be executed. Defaults to the current working directory.
