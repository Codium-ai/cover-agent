    Load and parse YAML data from a given response text.

    Parameters:
    response_text (str): The response text containing YAML data.
    keys_fix_yaml (List[str]): A list of keys to fix YAML formatting (default is an empty list).

    Returns:
    dict: The parsed YAML data.

    If parsing the YAML data directly fails, it attempts to fix the YAML formatting using the 'try_fix_yaml' function.

    Parameters:
    response_text (str): The response text that may contain YAML data with formatting issues.
    keys_fix_yaml (List[str]): A list of keys to fix YAML formatting (default is an empty list).

    Returns:
    dict: The parsed YAML data after attempting to fix formatting issues.

    The function tries multiple fallback strategies to fix YAML formatting issues:
    1. Tries to convert lines containing specific keys to multiline format.
    2. Tries to extract YAML snippet enclosed between ```yaml``` tags.
    3. Tries to remove leading and trailing curly brackets.
    4. Tries to remove last lines iteratively to fix the formatting.

    If none of the strategies succeed, an empty dictionary is returned.
