# Integration tests for Cover Agent
This folder contains end-to-end integration tests for Cover Agent

## Prerequisites
Before running any of these tests you will need to build the installer package by running the following command from the root of the repository:
```
make installer
```

You will also need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

Note: These scripts were written for Linux but they have been tested on a Windows system using WSL 2 and Docker for Desktop.

## How to run
You can run these example test suites using a locally hosted LLM or in the cloud just as you would normally with Cover Agent

### Running the Tests
To run the full test suite simply run the following command from the root of the repository:
```
sh tests_integration/test_all.sh
```

Or run each test individually:
#### Python Fast API Example
````
sh tests_integration/test_with_docker.sh \
  --dockerfile "templated_tests/python_fastapi/Dockerfile" \
  --source-file-path "app.py" \
  --test-file-path "test_app.py" \
  --test-command "pytest --cov=. --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term"
````

#### Go Webservice Example
````
sh tests_integration/test_with_docker.sh \
  --dockerfile "templated_tests/go_webservice/Dockerfile" \
  --source-file-path "app.go" \
  --test-file-path "app_test.go" \
  --test-command "go test -coverprofile=coverage.out && gocov convert coverage.out | gocov-xml > coverage.xml" \
  --model "gpt-4o"
````

### Using Different LLMs
You can use a different LLM by passing in the `--model` and `--api-base` parameters. For example, to use a locally hosted LLM with Ollama you can pass in:
```
--model "ollama/mistral" --api-base "http://host.docker.internal:11434"
```

For any other LLM that requires more environment variables to be set you will need to update the shell script and pass in the variables within the Docker command.

## When to run
This test suite is intended to run with real LLMs (either locally hosted on online). If choosing cloud provided LLMs keep in mind that there is a cost associated with running these tests.

These tests should **absolutely** be run before a massive refactor or any major changes to the LLM/prompting logic of the code.

## How it works
The integration tests run within Docker containers in order to prove out complete isolation from any external or existing environment

# Increasing Coverage Iteratively
The `increase_coverage.py` script attempts to run Cover Agent for all files within the `cover_agent` directory. You'll need to call a Poetry shell first before running like so:
```
poetry install
poetry shell
python tests_integration/increase_coverage.py
```
