## Instructions for Adding Another Coverage Type to the `CoverageProcessor` Class

To add another coverage type to the `CoverageProcessor` class, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Update the `coverage_type` Argument

1. **Add the new coverage type to the `Literal` type hint** in the `CoverageProcessor` class initializer.

```python
class CoverageProcessor:
    def __init__(
        self, file_path: str, src_file_path: str, coverage_type: Literal["cobertura", "lcov", "jacoco", "new_coverage_type"]
    ):
        # Initialization code remains the same
```

### Step 2: Update the `parse_coverage_report` Method

1. **Add a new `elif` block** to handle the new coverage type.

```python
def parse_coverage_report(self) -> Tuple[list, list, float]:
    if self.coverage_type == "cobertura":
        return self.parse_coverage_report_cobertura()
    elif self.coverage_type == "lcov":
        # Placeholder for LCOV report parsing
        raise NotImplementedError(
            f"Parsing for {self.coverage_type} coverage reports is not implemented yet."
        )
    elif self.coverage_type == "jacoco":
        return self.parse_coverage_report_jacoco()
    elif self.coverage_type == "new_coverage_type":
        return self.parse_coverage_report_new_coverage_type()
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported coverage report type: {self.coverage_type}")
```

### Step 3: Implement the New Coverage Report Parsing Method

1. **Create a new method** to handle the parsing of the new coverage report type.

```python
def parse_coverage_report_new_coverage_type(self) -> Tuple[list, list, float]:
    """
    Parses a new coverage report type to extract covered and missed line numbers for a specific file,
    and calculates the coverage percentage.

    Returns:
        Tuple[list, list, float]: A tuple containing lists of covered and missed line numbers, and the coverage percentage.
    """
    # Example implementation - replace with actual parsing logic
    lines_covered, lines_missed = [], []
    # Parsing logic for the new coverage report type
    # For example, if the report is in JSON format:
    import json
    with open(self.file_path, 'r') as f:
        report_data = json.load(f)
        # Example logic to process the JSON data
        filename = os.path.basename(self.src_file_path)
        for file_data in report_data.get('files', []):
            if file_data.get('filename') == filename:
                for line in file_data.get('lines', []):
                    line_number = line.get('number')
                    hits = line.get('hits')
                    if hits > 0:
                        lines_covered.append(line_number)
                    else:
                        lines_missed.append(line_number)
                break

    total_lines = len(lines_covered) + len(lines_missed)
    coverage_percentage = (
        (len(lines_covered) / total_lines) if total_lines > 0 else 0
    )

    return lines_covered, lines_missed, coverage_percentage
```

### Step 4: Test the Implementation

1. **Ensure the new coverage report type is properly parsed** by adding unit tests to `tests/test_CoverageProcessor.py`.
2. **Verify the `CoverageProcessor` works with the new coverage type** by running the tests and checking the output.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can extend the `CoverageProcessor` class to support additional coverage report types, ensuring flexibility and adaptability for different coverage formats.
